            <h2>What is Internet ?</h2>
        </li>
        <p>The <u> <i> Internet </i></u> is a global network of computers and devices that are connected together to
            share information and communicate.</p>
        <p>At its core, it's a huge system of interconnected networks that uses standardized rules (called
            protocols, like TCP/IP) so devices can "talk" to each other.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Worldwide connection: It links billions of computers, smartphones, servers, and other devices across
                the globe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Data exchange: It allows information (text, images, videos, files, etc.) to move quickly between
                devices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Services: It powers things like websites (the World Wide Web), email, social media, messaging apps,
                online games, cloud storage, and more. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Infrastructure: Underneath, it relies on cables (undersea and on land), satellites, cell towers, and
                data centers.</p>
        </li>
        In short term :- <u>The Internet is the backbone that makes modern communication, knowledge-sharing, and
            online services possible.</u>

            <h2>Types of IP Addresses ?</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            An <u><i>IP address (Internet Protocol address)</i></u> is a unique number assigned to every device
            connected to the Internet (like your phone, computer, or even smart TV). It works like a digital address so
            devices can find and talk to each other.
        </p>
        <h3>Type of IP address :</h3>
        <p>There are two types of IP Address i.e. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol
            version6)</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Format: 192.168.1.1 (four numbers, each 0-255)</li>
                <li>Example: 8.8.8.8 (Google's DNS server)</li>
                <li>About 4.3 billion possible addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 (uses hexadecimal and colons)</li>
                <li>Created because we were running out of IPv4 addresses.</li>
                <li>Has an almost unlimited supply of addresses.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Kinds of IP Addresses :</h3>
        <p>
            <li><b>Public IP</b>: The main address your internet provider gives you (visible on the internet).</li>
            <li><b>Private IP</b>: Used inside your home or office network (like 192.168.x.x).</li>
            <li><b> Static IP</b>: Fixed address that never changes (often used by servers/websites).</li>
            <li><b> Dynamic IP</b>: Changes each time you connect to the internet (most common for home users).</li>
        </p> <br>

            <h2>What is MAC Address ?</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            A <u> MAC address </u>(Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier built into your
            device's network card (Wi-Fi card, Ethernet card, Bluetooth, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>It's like a serial number for your device's network interface.</li>
            <li>Unlike an IP address (which can change), a MAC address is permanent (though it can be spoofed or changed
                by software).</li>
        </p>
        <h4>Format :</h4>
        <p>Usually written as 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F).
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            First is :-00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
            <br>
            Second is :-00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E
        </p>
        <h4> Purpose :</h4>
        <p>
            1. Identifies devices at the hardware level inside a local network (LAN).
            <br>
            2. Used in Ethernet and Wi-Fi communication.
            <br>
            3. Helps switches and routers deliver data to the right device.

            <h2> What is a Port Number ?</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            A <u> Port number </u> is like a virtual door on your computer or device that helps identify specific
            services or applications when data is sent or received over the internet.
        </p>
        <h3>Think of it like this :</h3>
        <p>
            Your IP address = your house address (where to send data).
            <br><br>
            Your Port number = the specific room or person inside the house (which program/service should handle the
            data).
        </p>
        <h4>Format :</h4>
        <p>
            A port number is a 16-bit number (0 to 65,535).
            <br><br>
            Always paired with an IP address in the format:
            <br>
            IP:Port <br>
            Example → 192.168.1.5:80
        </p>
        <h3>Why are Port Number important !</h3>
        <p>
            They allow <u><i>multiple services </i></u> to run on the same device without conflict.
            <br><br>
            Example: Your computer might browse a website (port 443), send an email (port 25), and download a file via
            FTP (port 21) — all at the same time.
            <br><br>
            Firewalls and routers use them to allow or block traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Port Range :-</h4>
        1. Well-Known Ports (0-1023):-
        <br><br>
        80 → HTTP (websites)
        <br>
        443 → HTTPS (secure websites)
        <br>
        25 → SMTP (email sending)
        <br>
        22 → SSH (remote login)
        <br><br>
        2. Registered Ports (1024-49151):--
        <br><br>
        3306 → MySQL database
        <br>
        3389 → Remote Desktop (RDP)
        <br><br>
        3. Dynamic/Ephemeral Ports (49152-65535)
        <br><br>

            <h2>What is DNS ?</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. <br><br>
            It translates human-friendly names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78) so
            computers can find each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNS is the global, distributed system that translates the human-friendly domain names into the
            computer-friendly IP addresses. Without it, you'd have to memorize hundreds of IP addresses to browse the
            web.
        </p>
        <h3>How DNS Works (Step by Step) ?</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Browser Check : First, your computer checks if it already knows the IP (cached).</li>
            <li>DNS Resolver : If not, it asks a DNS resolver (usually your ISP or Google DNS 8.8.8.8).</li>
            <li>Root Server : If the resolver doesn't know, it asks a root DNS server.</li>
            <li>TLD Server: The root server directs it to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com server).</li>
            <li>Authoritative Server: That points to the authoritative DNS server for youtube.com.</li>
            <li>Get IP Address: The server replies with the real IP (e.g., 142.250.190.78).</li>
            <li>Connect : Your browser uses that IP to load YouTube.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Note :-This whole process usually happens in milliseconds.</h4>
        <h4>Common Public DNS Servers :-</h4>
        Google DNS → 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
        <br>
        Cloudflare DNS → 1.1.1.1
        <br>
        OpenDNS → 208.67.222.222
